# üåü Overview
The Vietnam War (1955‚Äì1975) was a significant historical event involving extensive air force operations. This project leverages the THOR (Theater History of Operations Reports) database to explore and analyze aerial bombings during this period. The dataset provides comprehensive details on missions, aircraft, and operational aspects, making it an invaluable resource for historical and tactical analysis.

Key areas of analysis include:

* Trends in bombing operations over time.
* Aircraft models and their contributions.
* Weapon types and load weights used during missions.
* Mission patterns by time of day, location, and operation type.
